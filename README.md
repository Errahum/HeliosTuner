# Fine-Tuning Project with OpenAI

This project guides you through the necessary steps to fine-tune a GPT model using the OpenAI API. Fine-tuning allows improving the model's performance on specific tasks by using additional training data.
Compared with openai, you can use the history of a conversation and keep it. What's more, you can have an ongoing conversation.
